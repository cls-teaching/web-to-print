## Course Description

The browser allows designers to create truly trans-media works by drawing from the same content to produce both digital and printed products. This course will use the browser to investigate systems and algorithms in graphic design in both digital and analog ways. The browser, in its mutability and its fraught relationship to form, will be used as a vehicle to interrogate and innovate layout techniques, typesetting, hierarchy, and visual form. Students will build skills in HTML, CSS, & Javascript as well as learn print production techniques in this analog-digital hybrid course.

## Course Goals

One of our goals for this topic studio is to encourage making along with intellectual rigor and discussion, yet also empower you with a sense of independence and ownership of your work. We aim to set up the best possible conditions and productive project prompts to encourage your independent investigations through some shared objectives. Our primary role as instructors is to reflect on the ideas you bring forward, and to challenge and provoke discussion between class participants. The understanding being that “challenge” and “provocation” are ways of pushing your work forward and engaging in critical conversation at a very high level. In truth, your projects belong to each of you and we are excited to see how you respond both as individuals and as a class.

## Course Learning Outcomes

Using unusual Tools

Using Browser to find and/or generate content and form

Print production

Formal Exploration/experimentation

Ability to read code concepts (HTML CSS)

## Format

Class meets 2 times a week (6 hours) and centers on studio work and critiques. Our activities will include:

– Studio Projects supported by in-class critiques

– Assigned readings and discussions

– In class exercises

## Themes

Democratization of tools

Machine aesthetics

Dynamic Content

Made in Browser / Found in Browser

## Evaluation

Participation 25%

Presentation 25%

Projects 50%

### Participation

Students are expected to actively participate in class through critique and discussion of assigned readings. Through discussing your own projects and the work of your classmates, you will develop a critical point of view about your practice as a designer. Like process and craft, this is a skill that grows easier through use.

### Presentation

Work should be presented in an orderly fashion. Good presentation will allow us to focus on the process and evolution of the work. Projects should be clearly labelled and displayed in a considered manner. Students are expected to provide thorough documentation of their process and final outcomes.

### Graduate Grading Scale

A – outstanding performance and participation

B – good performance and participation

C – average performance and participation

D – low performance, inadequate, course must be repeated in order to graduate

F – Fail, inadequate, course must be repeated in order to graduate

Grades of C- or less are considered a failing grade for the required

courses within the major. Students will need to repeat the course

and achieve a grade of C or better to advance to the next level.

You are required to complete all coursework on time: each

assignment is to be finished by the start of class the day it is due

unless specified otherwise. Work completed after this time, but

before the start of the next class period will be marked down a full

letter grade.

At midterm, students who are not passing the class or are having attendance problems will be informed via email by the instructors.

### Attendance Policy

- Regular attendance and on-time arrival are required
- Three unexcused absences = unconditional fail
- Three lates (more than 15 minutes) = one unexcused absence
- Email instructors if you are sick, or you must miss a class
