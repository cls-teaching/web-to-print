# Project 1: Printing the Web

“For us, makers, the creative process has transformed into a series of digital clicks and actions. These actions are temporary. Once executed, they disappear from the screen. We can hardly trace back how things looked when we were creating them. Is there a way we can archive, publish and reproduce these actions?”

– Inez Cox

## Prompt

What does the web look like translated into printed form?
What is the underlying architecture of an interface?
How can we translate intangible interfaces experiences (clicks, scrolls, rollovers, animations, responsiveness, etc…) to ink and paper?

Goal:   
Visual research, striping down content to abstraction of container. Container as content.

## Process

### Step 1
We will draw from a hat and assign everyone a website you probably use weekly (if not everyday).

Websites:
google search
Facebook
Tumblr
instagram
Twitter,
Pinterest
Youtube
google docs
drop box
Pandora
Netflix
Redit
Wikipedia

Sept 5 / In class

Write a description of what you interface does. Answer questions like:
What is it’s purpose?
What can it do?
Who are its users?
How would you describe its interface (intuitive, prescriptive, linear, random, etc…)
What are the interface’s characteristics?

### Step 2: Analyze Interface Architecture

The “architecture” of an interface mediates how we see and interpret content. Observe, record, remix, recycle, map these digital actions and frameworks.

Do exhaustive visual studies, create 30 versions on 11 x 17 paper.
Objective is to reveal the underlying architecture of your given interface.
Deconstruct? Reveal? Distill?

10 cut paper / photocopy
10 on computer
10 3d

### Step 3

Distill your visual studies to a single poster any size (minimum size 24 x 36)
